A simple calculator written in C++ using wxWidgets. The code is not perfect. This is what newbies do in their free time. But you may find it useful for study purpose.

#Why wxWidgets and not Qt?
I like Qt, but as **Robert Frost** said:

#What does mfTreeUi.exe do?
It reads postfix expression from the file named "postfix.txt" and uses that data in order to generate the tree. When you click on the Tree button in the View menu, the calculator converts your expression to postfix and then runs mfTreeUi.exe.
